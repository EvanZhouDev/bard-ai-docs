# No `fetch`? No problem.

`bard-ai` uses Node's experimental `fetch` function, which is enabled by default now. However, if the environment you are in still doesn't support it, simply install a polyfill, and inject it into global scope.

<Steps>
### Step 1
Install `node-fetch`
```bash copy
npm install node-fetch
```

### Step 2

Inject `fetch` into global scope

```javascript copy
import fetch from "node-fetch";
globalThis.fetch = fetch;
```

### Step 3

Include `bard-ai` after that codeblock

```javascript copy
import Bard from "bard-ai";
```

</Steps>
