# The `useJSON` Flag

This flag is used in [`Bard.askAI()`](/basics/askAI) and [`Bard.Chat.ask()`](/basics/chat#bardchatask).

Use this flag to get more information about the return request from Bard.

## Return Structure

```js
{
    "content": string,
    "images": [
        {
            "tag": string,
            "url": string,
        },
        ...
    ] | undefined,
    "ids": object
}
```

Let's walk through what each one of these properties is.

| Property Name     | Type   | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `content`         | string | The Markdown return value of Bard                      |
| `images`          | object \| undefined | An array of objects with `tag` and `url` properties. Will be `undefined` if no images.    |
| `images[idx].tag` | string | The Markdown tag that is associated with the image.    |
| `images[idx].url` | string | The actual URL that leads to the images.               |
| `ids`             | object | An object that is used to import/export conversations. |

Usually it should not be necessary to use this flag, but it can be used for some certain scenarios, especially if you want to extend this library in some way.
