# Importing and Exporting Chats

Sometimes, when you need to continue a chat, its necessary to export your chat into some form of a file, or `localStorage`, and then later import it again. `bard-ai` has the ability to do this built in.

# Example

Let's start by creating a new chat.

```javascript copy
import Bard from "bard-ai";

await Bard.init(COOKIE_KEY);

let myConversation = new Bard.Chat();
```

Now, let's ask a question.

```javascript copy
console.log(await myConversation.ask("What is 1+1?"));
```

We then call the export function.

```javascript copy
myConversation.export();
```

You should get a object similar to this:

```json
{
    "conversationID": string,
    "responseID": string,
    "choiceID": string,
    "_reqID": string
}
```

Now, we create a new conversation, but we use the JSON we got to create it, like this:

```javascript copy
import Bard from "bard-ai";

await Bard.init(COOKIE_KEY);

let myConversationContinued = new Bard.Chat({
	conversationID: string,
	responseID: string,
	choiceID: string,
	_reqID: string,
});
```

Finally, we ask Bard a continuation of the original question (What is 1+1?):

```javascript copy
console.log(await myConversationContinued.ask("Add 1 to that"));
```

Bard should be able to catch on, and say `3`!

## Usage

<Callout>`export` will be first explained, then how to re-import.</Callout>

### `Bard.Chat.export()`

Takes no parameters, and returns an object in this format:

```json
{
    "conversationID": string,
    "responseID": string,
    "choiceID": string,
    "_reqID": string
}
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  Make sure to not edit this JSON at **all** when importing. A tiny change will render it to not work.
</Callout>

These IDs keep track of the entire conversation, which message you are on, and more.

`bard-ai` does not handle saving the conversation, so you'll have to supply your own file control and/or `localStorage` control. This is because of 2 things, that are somewhat intertwined:
- The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), that says each part of your code should do one thing.
- Keeps the library size down, to make it lighter and faster to download.

### `Bard.Chat(IDs)`

`Bard.Chat()` takes in one argument, the IDs you obtained from the export above. The chat will simply be initialized with the IDs, and can then be used as normal.
