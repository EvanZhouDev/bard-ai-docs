# `Chat` Object

<Callout type="info">
	Make sure you read through the [Authentication](/prerequisites/authentication)
	page first, if you haven't already.
</Callout>

A Class under the overarching `Bard` object, used for continued conversations with Bard.

## Example

```javascript copy showLineNumbers {5-7}
import Bard from "bard-ai";

await Bard.init(COOKIE_KEY);

let myConversation = new Bard.Chat();
console.log(await myConversation.ask("How are you?"));
console.log(await myConversation.ask("What's the last thing I said?"));
```

## Arguments

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ids`     | object | Used for [importing](/advanced/importExportChat) a previous conversation. If left blank, creates a new conversation. |

## Usage

Create a new conversation with the following code:

```javascript copy
let myConversation = new Bard.Chat();
```

### `Bard.Chat.ask()`

Asks something to the current `Bard.Chat()` instance.

#### Example

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
import Bard from "bard-ai";

await Bard.init(COOKIE_KEY);

let myConversation = new Bard.Chat();
console.log(await myConversation.ask("What is 1+1?"));
console.log(await myConversation.ask("What is 1 more than that?"));
```

#### Usage
Call `Bard.Chat.ask()` asynchronously on the same instance of `Bard.Chat`, and it will remember what was previously said. This is similar to continuing on a "Chat" in ChatGPT.

<Callout type="info">
The `Bard.Chat.ask()` method has the exact same syntax as `Bard.askAI()` (in fact, they call the same function under the hood). This means that it also supports the [`useJSON`](/advanced/useJSON) flag. Check the [documentation for `Bard.askAI()`](/basics/askAI) for more information.

### `Bard.Chat.export()`

Exports the current conversation. Go to [Importing/Exporting Chats](/advanced/importExportChat) to learn more.
