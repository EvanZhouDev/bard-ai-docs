To get your first AI output from Bard, copy and paste the following code into your IDE of choice:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
import Bard, { askAI } from "bard-ai";

await Bard.init(COOKIE_KEY);

console.log(await askAI("Hello world!"));
```

Let's walk through what this code is doing:
<Steps>
### Imports
```javascript copy
import Bard, { askAI } from "bard-ai";
```
We start by importing the overarching `Bard` Object from `bard-ai`, as well as the askAI sub-function alongside it. (We do this to avoid having to write the longer `Bard.askAI()`, but it also works)

### Initialization
```javascript copy
await Bard.init(COOKIE_KEY);
```
Next, we need to initialize `bard-ai`. Because this makes a web request and takes time, make sure to use `await` syntax. Be sure to use your own key here!

### Ask Bard!
```javascript copy
console.log(await askAI("Hello world!"));
```
Finally, we use the `askAI` function, with the first parameter of the query to ask Bard something. We log the output.
</Steps>

Congratulations! You've made your first request with Bard. Read on for more detailed documentation, including how to continue chats, export conversations, recieve image URLs from Bard, and more.
