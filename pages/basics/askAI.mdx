# `askAI` Function

<Callout type="info">

	page first, if you haven't already.
</Callout>

A function under the overarching `Bard` object, used for one-time queries to Bard.

## Example

```javascript copy showLineNumbers {5}
import Bard, { askAI } from "bard-ai";

await Bard.init(COOKIE_KEY);

console.log(await askAI("Hello world!"));
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type    | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `message` | string  | The message you are querying Bard with. Required. |
| `useJSON` | boolean | Whether or not to receive JSON response format. Default is `false`  |

## Usage
The most simple usage simply involves passing your message into `askAI`, and calling it async. The response of `askAI` is a string in Markdown format, and it includes images, codeblocks, and other Markdown accessories.

	Notice how `askAI` is imported _alongside_ the `Bard` object, with a deconstructuring import. Essentially, I am importing the `askAI` method of the `Bard` object separately, so that it is more concise to use. Feel free to also import `Bard` normally, and call `askAI` with `Bard.askAI()` instead.

You may also choose to pass in a secondary parameter to opt into recieving a JSON response. Read more about the JSON response [here](/advanced/useJSON).
