# Initialization of `bard-ai`

<Callout type="info">
	Make sure you read through the [Authentication](/prerequisites/authentication)
	page first, if you haven't already.
</Callout>

After obtaining your key, you are going to have to initialize it, so that `bard-ai` knows it. You key remains local on your device, so no one else can see it.

## Example

```javascript copy showLineNumbers {3}
import Bard from "bard-ai";

await Bard.init(COOKIE_KEY);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type    | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `key` | string  | The `COOKIE_KEY` you are initializing with. Required. |

## Usage
Simply call the asynchronous function `Bard.init()`, with your cookie key, exactly as it is shown in the example above. It is recommended to store the key in a secure location, and then access it in your file indirectly. This will limit accidently committing or sending your key to GitHub or other platforms.
